# Plot outline

## Prologue

* Come to your senses in a remote mining system, email indicator blinking
* Lab team left cryptic message wishing you best (msgs/readme.md)
* After 1 jump, get Strauss's message about encrypted journals (msgs/strauss-1.msg)
* Buy a mining laser, do some mining to earn a bit of cash?
* Do some cargo runs or missions within Tana
 * You can't leave Tana because you can't get a background check needed for Sol portal clearance
* You can probably decrypt the rot13 journal on your own, some hints on newsgroup?
* Try to accept a passenger mission, mission aborts due to not having life-support
* Buy life support, run a passenger mission or two
* Eventually accept mission to take Nari home
* She figures out that whoa holy crap; you're a machine consciousness
* Nari helps you pass the background check needed for the portal

TODO: how do we make sure that you don't miss Nari's mission?

## Tracking down echoes of Traxus

* Nari helps you decrypt the polyalphabetic journal(s)
 * The one that records when Traxus first contacts you
* She knows someone whose mother worked on the machine consciousness project (not Bohk team)
* Track them down, find out about the connection between MC project and spacetime junction

TODO: flesh this out more; who is it you find, and how do they know what they tell you?

## Spacetime Junction

* Somehow you recruit Clay Dorath
* He leads you on a trail that eventually gets you to finding the spacetime junction
* Then he betrays you to get revenge on his former lab mates--boo!
 * Tries to pin the theft on them?
* A ship comes in to intercept you; if they reach you and board your ship it's game-over
* But you can use the spacetime junction to reset back to the point where you first find it
 * Maybe Nari installs the junction so it triggers automatically if you're in critical danger
 * Somehow you use this trick to avert capture?

TODO: need a ton more detail here

## Some more chapters

At this point, progress up to the endgame section should consist only
of learning new things, because now that you can reset the game state
with the junction (and will need to reset the game state to solve some
puzzles) changes to the state of things outside your ship will be
thrown away.

Threads to explore:

* Tracking down logs from the MC research team that created you
* Learning more about the portal system and its Scheme OS
* Find out that Ikon is a shell company for Traxus
 * You should have heard about Ikon a fair bit before finding this out

Can we find a way to make auto-pilot functionality necessary to the plot?
Purchase additional ships and load them up with auto-pilot?

## Endgame: Ikon Technologies and the Domain Injector

* Find out that Traxus has colonized his own world
* Learn how to log into portal computer console
 * Subvert security features; allow portal to secret colony

This is already laid out in some detail at the bottom of readme

* You get the domain injector and have power to bend reality to your will; the end
