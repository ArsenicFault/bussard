# Challenges

## Escape the initial system

You awaken in orbit with dex-19 having reactivated you. He wants to get out of
the system, and so do you, so you can work together.

* Objective: pass thru the portal
 * Need to read dex-19 email (skill: operating editor)
 * Fly to Merdeka station (skill: piloting)
 * Break into the license database and insert a record for your ship (skill: orb, SQL)

## Unlock the spacetime junction

All systems are open to you here, except Katilay?

dex-19 tells you that you're a unique construct in that you have access to a
spacetime junction, which functions as a kind of save point. In order to find
out how to activate it, you need to track down some docs.

Rocanna is the one who knows how the junction works, but she doesn't trust
Traxus and can't be told why you want to activate it?

* Objective: learn how to reset the game state
 * Find documentation, somewhere in Bohk?
 * Create the junction point (skill: forth programming)
 * Activate the junction point (skill: forth programming)

Once you activate it for the first time, dex-19 notices that it's working, and
he tells you of the plan to reactivate Traxus.

## Rovers!

You'll need access to rovers in order to do any land missions

* Objective: get a rover capable of movement and comms
 * Take PTMC intro (skill: rover deployment)
 * Complete PTMC training (skill: rover movement, lua coding optional)

The training courses consist of emails and guided exercises where the rover
transmits instructions you in response to what you tell it to do.

## Reactivate Traxus

* Objective: reactivate Traxus's base
 * Find the location of the base (skill: map?)
 * Land a rover there (skill: rover deploy)
 * Bring the reactor online (skill: lisp programming)
 * Subvert security measures to reach Traxus (skill: rover movement)
 * Fix communications array, connecting Traxus to network

Once you've brought the reactor online, the whole time you're working to
connect him to the network he is talking to you in ways that make you more and
more uncomfortable with the idea of reactivating him.

Once you bring him online he begins his plan of making the humans pay. Realize
that was a terrible mistake, activate spacetime junction to reset.

## Stop Traxus's followers and that other guy

Katilay portal access is limited due to damage.

* Somehow get back to Katilay
 * Gain creds for the portal thru password logger (skill: lua programming)
 * Log in and activate the portal (skill: lisp programming)

Reset the junction so you can return to this point.

Ultimate showdown here!
