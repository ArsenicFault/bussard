I got stuck at registration for a hundred kiloseconds yesterday when
they informed me my Collision Avoidance System needed an upgrade. I
couldn't believe they'd keep my ship stuck there for so long; I nearly
missed a delivery deadline. Is it just me, or are they becoming more and
more strict about this? It's getting ridiculous.

Yeah, I've noticed this; the delays are worse than they used to be.

Listen, I know it may not be the most convenient thing for you space
cowboys, but those of us who live on an actual planet are quite glad for
anything that keeps you careless pilots from crashing into us.

Oh come on; what's the worst that could happen? Some poor sod vaporizing
in the sky providing you with pretty fireworks?

You really have no idea, do you? Even at a measley 3 km/s, any object
will impact with the equivalent energy of its own mass in TNT. Speed it
up by the kind of acceleration you seen in the gravity well of even a
mid-sized planet, and a typical freighter impact would easily be in the
hundred-megaton range.

So yeah, let's have a little less whining and a little more gratitude that
entire colonies don't get razed when some sleep-deprived captain bumps
his elbow against his throttle.
