I'm curious to learn about protocols, so I'm thinking of writing my own subnet
client. It looks like the `ssh_get_connection` function on my ship can be used
to run commands and get the output back in a way I can use for my own programs,
but the output itself is pretty confusing.

There's actually pretty decent description of the subnet protocol available
online if you use the subnet system's built-in help. Here's the encoded message
for the help command:

    d7:command4:helpe

That will tell you a fair bit about how to handle the decoding part. But you'll
also need to know about how to get messages; I think that would be something
like sending this and parsing the response to get a table of groups that contain
messages:

    d7:command6:groupe

You'd have an outer loop that lists all the groups, then an inner loop that
takes each group and lists all the messages, requesting each one and copying it
into your ship's `docs.mail[group]` table.

Just remember that the encoding/decoding of commands and responses is a separate
step from the action of fetching and storing the messages.
