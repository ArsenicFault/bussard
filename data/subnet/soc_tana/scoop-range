When I'm out mining, sometimes getting within scoop range is a real
pain. I've been looking around for upgraded scoops, but they're pretty
pricey. Does it make sense to drop some serious credits on one of these?

Remember that your laser effectiveness decreases pretty quickly with
distance. Upgrading your scoop isn't as helpful as it sounds if your
laser still only works effectively at close distances.
