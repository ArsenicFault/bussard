It seems like Sol is benefiting an awful lot from the mining going on
here in Tana. It makes you wonder if we'll ever get our independence. I
remember reading that Bohk was granted independence early after it was
colonized; maybe the same thing will happen here.

Comparing the situation here with the one in Bohk is really
misleading. You have to remember most colonies were begun back in the
age of light-speed communication. Even if the Solar Union did want to
keep control over the newly-founded Bohk colony, all communications
would have taken about half a gigasecond to arrive in each
direction. You can't really maintain a colonial power at that kind of
distance.

Now things are different; we have our portals, and you can get
from Tana Prime to Earth in a single day.

Technically Bohk didn't secede from the Solar Union; it was still the
Terran Republic at that point. The Solar Union didn't declare
independence from the republic until over a century later.

But anyway, the other main difference in our case with Tana is that
we're completely dependent on contact with Sol for our food. Bohk's
colonists knew they couldn't depend on supplies reaching them, so they
had to build bigger colony ships that included everything they needed
for self-sufficient agriculture.

Maybe we'd be better off if the Tana colony ships had done the same, but
my understanding is that once the Republic authorized sending portals on
the colony ships, they wanted to get them out as quickly as possible.
