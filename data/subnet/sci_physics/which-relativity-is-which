I always get general relativity confused with special relativity. Which
is which again?

Special relativity is called "special" because it only holds in that
particular special case where the effects of gravity are
negligible. Remember that it was develeped first as a theory, and it
wasn't till later that the ideas of relativity could be applied generally.

Huh, I always just remember *G*eneral relativity applies to
*G*ravity. Easier to remember, but your explanation makes more sense.
