Has anyone seen Elwin Dorath posting recently? He said he was going to
help me out with a project I've got going, but he's been unresponsive to
my messages, which isn't like him.

He emailed me from Sutap about a week ago, but I haven't heard from him since.

Thanks. I really need to get in touch with him, so I'd be willing to
hire anyone with a ship (and a bit of coding skills) to go investigate
and see if you can find him. I'm getting pretty worried at this point.
There's 500 credits in it for anyone who can bring him to Kembali Station.
