Welcome to Nee Soon Station, Sol's finest research lab, founded 2110.

While Nee Soon Station is an open port that serves all, its more
remote orbit means it doesn't get the bustling traffic of the inner
ports. The primary activities occurring here center around Traxus
Research, one of the Solar Union's foremost technology enterprises.
