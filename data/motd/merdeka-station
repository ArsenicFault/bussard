Welcome to Merdeka Station, humankind's newest colony, founded 2427 in L-668-21.

This station boasts the most active mineral refinery in all human
space. Located in one of four colonized systems of the Tana
Protectorate, it is the newest colony and the furthest from Earth of
any colonized world. A steady stream of mining ships come and go from
here hoping to tap the great mineral wealth of the system's asteroids.
