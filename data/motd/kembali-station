Welcome to Kembali Station, first of the Tana colonies, founded 2396.

The Tana Protectorate began here and now encompasses six colonies in
four systems. When the Tana expedition was first launched it was
thought that Bangunan, the planet here orbiting Luyten's Star, would be
suitable for habitation, so it was originally intended to be the
capital of Tana. However the initial probes failed to detect its
periodic violent seismic activity, the strength of which renders it
unsuitable for colonization.

Today Kembali Station functions as a hub for all travel between Sol
and the rest of the Tana worlds, and still handles many of the
administrative aspects of interstellar trade.
