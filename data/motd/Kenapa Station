Welcome to Kenapa Station, industrial heart of Tana, founded 2405.

When the SS Planck arrived to colonize the Tana system, most of the
colonists settled down on Tana Prime. However, the colony ship was
later turned into a station, which now hosts a growing manufacturing
sector.

This system is also home to Tana Prime and Lioboro.
