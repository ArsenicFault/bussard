Welcome to Sutep, Bohk's biggest tourist destination, founded 2355.

Sutep is best known for its glimmering caverns with bioluminescent
plants sprawling through it, which were discovered more than a hundred
years after Changlan was colonized. This has led to a bustling tourism
industry as hotels and resorts have sprung up to serve thrill seekers
from all over.
