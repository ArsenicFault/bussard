Welcome to Mars, humankind's first colony, founded 2038.

Though it is ill-suited for human habitation, Mars has long held
the imagination of Earthers dreaming for a better life. Many go on
from here after a few years to work the asteroid belts or even
emigrate out further to extrasolar colonies, but somehow Mars still
draws wanderers from Earth on a regular basis.
