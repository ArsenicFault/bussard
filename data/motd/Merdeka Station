Welcome to Merdeka Station, humankind's newest colony, founded 2427 in L-668-21.

This station boasts the most active mineral refinery in all human
space. Located in one of four colonized systems of the Tana
Protectorate, it is the newest colony and the furthest from Earth of
any colonized world. A steady stream of mining ships come and go from
here hoping to tap the great mineral wealth of the system's asteroids.

Though the colonization ships for each of the Tana systems were
launched at the same time, contact was lost with the SS Poincare
midway through its voyage to L-668-21. Once it became clear the
Poincare was not going arrive, Tana Prime launched the SS Archimedes,
which successfully began the colony here.
