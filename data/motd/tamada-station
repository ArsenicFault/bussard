Welcome to Tamada Station, founded 2348.

Tamada Station was founded in the last century by the crew of the
colony ship SS Pythagoras. Launched from Lalande, they ran into
trouble when they arrived at their destination with an inoperable
portal. Determined to stand by their duty even when the colonists
insisted on attempting a return voyage, they put down an uprising and
converted the colony ship into what is now called Tamada Station.

Eventually a second colony ship was able to re-establish contact
between the Katilay system and the rest of the portal network, but
Tamada Station is still a small, out-of-the-way port.
