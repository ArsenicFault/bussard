Welcome to Changlun, Bohk's first colony, founded 2218.

The New Phobos system was the first to be colonized by a power
independent from the Terran Republic; the colony ship here was
launched from Bohk Prime in 2212. This was before the discovery of
portals, so communication back to the capital was still very
limited. However, Changlun never broke away from Bohk the way Bohk
broke away from the Republic.

These days Changlun is home to some of the best medical facilities of
any human world.
