Welcome to Kuchang Station, center of Terran academia, founded 2138.

Kuchang Station is the largest extrasolar space station. Originally
constructed from the SS Copernicus (the colony ship which brought the
first humans from Sol), Kuchang has grown immeasurably since then. It
now houses the Terran Republic's largest university as well as the
Aperture Technology, which built and regulates the portal network.
