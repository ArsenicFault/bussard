Welcome to Kuching Station, center of Terran academia, founded 2138.

Kuching Station is the largest extrasolar space station. Originally
constructed from the SS Copernicus (the colony ship which brought the
first humans from Sol), Kuching has grown drastically since then. It
now houses the Terran Republic's largest university as well as the
Aperture Technology, which built and regulates the portal network.
