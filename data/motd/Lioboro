Welcome to Lioboro, breadbasket of Tana, founded 2412.

Lioboro is a world whose economy revolves mostly around growing
food. Ten years after Tana Prime was settled, a desire to reduce their
dependence upon Sol led them to found a colony here. Though the
atmosphere is not hospitable to humans, the oceans support rich
growths of algae, which is crucial to the food supply of Tana's
worlds.
