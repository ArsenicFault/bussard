Welcome to Earth, birthplace of the human race.

Despite a flurry of colonization in the past few centuries, Earth is
still the most densely populated planet in human space by two orders
of magnitude. It is also still the most suitable world in known space
for growing food palatable to humans, so even though it boasts very
developed industry, the farms of Earth still feed many other worlds.
