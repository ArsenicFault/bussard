Welcome to Newton Station, the first space station, founded 2049.

Newton Station is the oldest space station to be created, and by far
the largest in existence. Its early growth came from belt miners eager
to exploit the nearby asteroid wealth, but it has since diversified to
house shipyards, research labs, habitation sections, shops, and more.
