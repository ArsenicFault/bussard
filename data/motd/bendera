Welcome to Bendera, the subterranean garden world, founded 2368.

Bendera is the second colony in the Lalande system, much smaller than
Sungai, the capital. The surface of the planet is wracked with
storms, but a geological survey nearly a century ago discovered that
the caverns deep beneath the surface featured nitrogen-rich soil that
could support many forms plant life from Earth. Since this discovery
it has come to be home to many colonists who miss the lush greenery of
Earth.

The planet of Sungai is also found in this system.
