Welcome to the ice fields of Solotogo, founded 2402.

Solotogo's immense ice fields and frozen deposits of noble gasses
provide the Tana Protectorate with many critical resources. In
addition, the star it orbits exhibits very unusual radiation patterns,
making it a point of interest for researchers wishing to understand
the stellar life cycle.
