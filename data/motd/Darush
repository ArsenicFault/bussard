Welcome to the Principality of Darush, founded 2143.

Darush is a small colony which is among one of the oldest.

Soon after the arrival of colonists in the Ross 128 system, an
accident involving a cargo shuttle threatened the SS Copernicus colony
ship. Quick thinking from Captain Darush saved the colony when he set
his ship on a collision course with the errant shuttle.

The family of Captain Darush were granted land rights to the planet in
his memory. While it is not large enough to sustain much population,
its mineral deposits have made his descendants quite wealthy.
