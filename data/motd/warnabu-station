Welcome to Warnabu Station, Bohk's technology hub, founded 2189.

Warnabu Station was founded shortly after Bohk Prime from the colony
ship that brought humans to the system, following the conventional
wisdom of separating out the colonies in case of disaster. Its low
gravity eventually caused it attract industrial manufacturing and
semiconductor business, but it is now also host to a couple small
shipyards.
