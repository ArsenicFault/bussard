# Operating manual for Kosaga Shipyards Bussard-class spacecraft

Congratulations on the purchase of your spacecraft. Your ship is
equipped with state of the art components as well as the capacity to
dynamically reconfigure to add new capabilities.

Please review this manual to ensure you have a complete understanding
of your ship's operation, and you will enjoy many safe travels on board.

## Display

The first thing you'll see when you launch your ship is its
heads-up-display. At the right you'll see a readout indicating your
current velocity vector. Once you set a target, (`tab` by default)
you'll see below the velocity of your target, and below that the
gravitation acceleration your target is applying to your ship. A
targeting indicator will also point from your ship in the direction of
your current target. The upper left shows basic speed, coordinates,
target details, fuel readout, credits, and a clock.

## Helm control

Your ship comes pre-configured with a keymap which allows piloting the
ship using the `up`, `right`, and `left` arrow keys on your helm
keyboard. The `+` and `-` keys also allow you to zoom in and out of
your view. You can fly around the system as your fuel supply
permits. The ship's onboard collectors will replenish the fuel supply,
though slowly.

## Computer

The heart of your ship is its onboard computer. The Bussard-class
spacecraft is equipped with a LuaJIT-based control unit, offering a
high degree of flexibility and customization without sacrificing
performance.

At the bottom of the screen is the REPL (interactive code console)
where you can interact directly with your ship's onboard computer. By
default a single line is shown, which displays either the current line
of input (if applicable) or the last line of output. Pressing
`ctrl-enter` toggles the full repl, which allows you to scroll
through the previous output. While the full repl is active, the
piloting controls for your ship will be unavailable. Enter any Lua
code into the REPL to have it evaluated. See the API section below to
learn how to control your ship from code.

When your ship starts, it will load its init file in order to create
key bindings, define helper functions, and perform any other setup.

You can make changes to your init file using the onboard editor. Run
this code in your REPL: `ship:e("src.config")`. Once you're done with
your edits, press `esc` and load your changes with
`ship:load("src.config")`. You can edit other files in your ship by
passing another filename to `ship:e`, but by default only files in the
`ship.src` and `ship.docs` tables will stay after your ship is
restarted. You can configure it to save other tables by adding their
names to the `ship.persist` table.

### Keymaps and Modes

The currently active mode and its keymaps will dictate how your ship
will react to keys on your helm keyboard. Create a new mode with the
`keymap.define_mode("mymode")` function, which takes a string. Once a
mode is defined, you can add key bindings to it like so:
`keymap.define("flight", "ctrl-p", function() ship.ui.paused = true end)`.
The first argument is the name of the mode you're adding the key
binding to, the second argument is a string describing the key to
bind, and the third argument is the function to call when the key is
pressed. This function is passed a boolean indicating whether it is a
repeated key or not.

See the `keycodes` manual page for a detailed listing of available key
names. You can run `man("keycodes")` to view it.

By default your ship has a `"flight"` mode active by default and a
`"repl"` mode active when the REPL is full-screen. Note that
`"flight"` mode does have the simple one-line REPL available. There is
also an `"edit"` mode where the editor key bindings are defined. You
can check the current mode with `keymap.current_mode`.

Take a look at the default config code that came with your ship for an
example of how to create modes and bind new keys in them; it will come
in very handy to add in new keys when operating your ship.

### Communication system

When you are in range of a planet or space station with an active
computer, you can initiate a login session using your ship's
communication system. This will allow you to access any of the
station's services, including refueling, cargo transactions,
purchasing upgrades, downloading new libraries, renting cargo storage,
and communicating with others on board the station or elsewhere.

Your targeting indicator will turn green when you are within range of
a station that allows logins.

Sessions are initiated using the `ship.actions.login` function, which
will log you into the currently-targeted planet or station with the
provided username and password if you are within communications range.

Most stations allow limited access via a `guest` account with an empty
password, which is the default if no username and password are
provided. Files on guest accounts are wiped upon logout. Once you are
logged in as a guest, you may have the option to purchase an account
on that station or planet's computer system, which will grant you
access to the rest of the services as well as persistent file
storage. Please note that attempting to access accounts of others is
strictly forbidden by interstellar law.

Services offered on stations vary by locale, but most stations at
least offer to buy and sell cargo. The `cargo` executable takes
`list`, `buy`, and `sell` subcommands; see its online help for usage
details.

While your session is active, you will not be able to enter any code
into your ship's REPL, and the REPL prompt will change to `$`. Enter
`logout` to terminate your session and return to your ship's REPL.

If you have an account on a station server, you can copy files to and
from the targeted station using
`ship.comm.scp("username:password/path/to/file", "path.in.ship")`
and `ship.comm.scp("path.in.ship", "username:password/path/to/file")`.

### API list

In your onboard computer, `ship` is a table representing the data and
functionality that can be accessed programmatically.

#### ship.sensors

The fields in this table primarily relate to your ship's flight
through space and other objects in space around it.

* `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`: position and velocity.
* `heading`: direction pointing, in radians.
* `target`: table representing the body (planet, star, station, portal, etc.) targeted.
* `system_name`: the name of the current system.
* `bodies`: an array of bodies present in the current system.

#### ship.status

These fields primarily convey the status of your ship's components and
its upgrades.

* `fuel`, `fuel_capacity`: current and maximum fuel levels.
* `mass`: current total mass of the ship, its upgrades, and its cargo.
* `engine_on`: boolean indicating whether the engine is firing.
* `turning_right`, `turning_left`: booleans for turning thrusters.
* `credits`: how many credits you have in the ship.
* `cargo`: a table of good names to tons of that good in your hold.
* `cargo_capacity`: the maximum total tonnage you can fit in your hold.
* `engine_strength`, `turning_speed`: capabilities of engine/turn thrusters.
* `burn_rate`: how quickly your engine consumes fuel.
* `recharge_rate`: how quickly your collector replenishes your fuel.
* `comm_connected`: whether or not the comm system is connected.
* `comm_range`: the maximum distance at which your comm is effective.
* `scoop_range`: the maximum distance at which you can collect mined asteroid ore.
* `in_range`: function (takes ship and body) returning boolean for
  whether the body is in range of the communication system. An optional
  third argument can determine whether it's within an arbitrary range.

#### ship.actions

* `forward`, `left`, `right`: accepts a boolean indicating whether to
  fire the given engine/thruster.
* `next_target`: cycle sequentially through all the targets in the system. `tab` by default, `shift-tab` to cycle in reverse.
* `closest_target`: select the closest available target. `ctrl-tab` by default.
* `login`: accepts optional username/password, attempts to establish a
  login session with the target if possible.

#### controls (flight)

This is a table of keys to functions; usually functions in the
`ship.actions` table above. These function slightly differently from
the keymap functionality described above. Keymaps can only be used for
commands that are triggered once per key press. Controls must be used
when the ship will behave differently based on how long the key is
held. All piloting functionality should use this table. The zoom
functions for changing the scale should use it too.

#### scale

A numeric indicator of how far out the display should be zoomed.

### Upgrades

Certain stations will sell you upgrades to your ship. These can either
introduce completely new components or improve the effectiveness of
existing components.

Once you have logged into a station that sells upgrades, you can run
the `upgrade` script to see their prices. Run `upgrade buy laser`, for
instance, to purchase a laser, provided you have enough credits. Once
you have purchased an upgrade, you can usually view its documentation
by logging out of the station and accessing its manual page with
`man("laser")`, etc.
