# Stations

Once you've stabilized your orbit a bit, log back into the
station. There are a few things you can do here. This will show you
the full list of commands you can run:

    ls /bin

Most commands explain how they work if you run them with "--help".
The most important to you right now is the upgrade command. You're
going to want a mining laser for your ship, so if you're on a station
(such as Mirduka or Kenapa Stations) where lasers are sold, run this next:

    upgrade buy laser

OK, that's enough at the station for now. You'll want to come back
later and try the "refuel" and "cargo" commands, but for now logout
and continue with:

    man("intro4")
