# PTMC Mining Laser Mk. I

The PTMC Mining Laser Mk. I is a heavy-duty deuterium-flouride laser
capable of operating at 64 megawatts. Its most popular application is
mining of metallic asteroids.

## Control

In order to fire your laser, it's recommended to bind it in the
`ship.controls` table. Left Alt is a common choice. Put this in your
ship's config file (normally accessible with ctrl-enter):

    ship.controls["lalt"] = ship.actions.laser

Be sure it's below the `ship.controls = { [...] }` section.
In order to reload your config with the changes you've made, switch to
the repl (usually ~) and run `ship:load("src.config")`.

This will fire the laser as long as the key is held down. However, if
you'd like a key to toggle it on and off, you can use something like
this instead:

    keymap.define("flight", "lalt", function() ship.actions.laser("toggle") end)

## Mining

Once you have targeted and approached an asteroid, fire your laser to
cut away at the asteroid. For larger asteroids, once the laser has cut
all the way through it, it may split in two. Otherwise if it is small
enough and your ship is within scoop range, it will be loaded into
your cargo bay, assuming there is room for it. The scoop range is
typically indicated by a change in the color of your targeting
indicator once you get close enough to the asteroid.

The safety features of this laser include a mechanism to automatically
drop the power levels to a harmless range when it detects that it is
pointed at a space station, planet, or spacecraft.
